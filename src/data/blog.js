            <p>An charitable organization, TOPE DARE FOUNDATION has reduced financial burdens of some parents in Ondo state by paying the 2021 JAMB examination fees of all the 149 final year students of St. Peter’s Unity Secondary, Akure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The founder of the organization, Engr Tope Dare, stated this in a post to one of the parents and obtained by SUNSHINETRUTH in Akure on Friday
            </p>
            <p>He said, “I am TOPE DARE an Old Student: In 1992, with the support of God and my late parents, I had an excellent WASC result with 7As and 2Cs and was opportuned to gain a university admission on 1st attempt of JAMB to study Electronic & Electrical Engineering at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife.

                “At my early age, I was brought up to understand that education shows us the importance of hard work and, at the same time, helps us to grow and develop in the society.

                “In giving back to the society and more importantly the school that built my solid educational foundation, my charitable organization, Tope Dare Foundation, has paid for the 2021 JAMB examination fees for all the 149 final year students of St. Peter’s Unity Secondary, Akure because I believe these children have a future bright with hope to be great and successful.</p>
            <p>
                “It is my expectation that this little seed being sown today shall germinate with fruits to produce successful scholars, global professionals, technocrats and business men that the society and school will be proud of.
                <q>
                    “God bless the parents, teachers and administrator of St. Peter’s Secondary School. Thank you. Tope Dare

                About Tope Dare Foundation…..

                The Tope Dare Foundation is a charity initiative of Tope Dare with the goal of giving back to the society and helping the less privileged and vulnerable in our communities to alleviate human suffering and create opportunities for a better life.

                The Tope Dare Foundation reaches out primarily to children who are vulnerable and may have otherwise been left to roam the streets with no hopes, children who were perhaps destined to live in poverty or become miscreants in our society.

                We strive to set these children on their way to a future incredibly different from that of the generations before them.

                We believe they have a future bright with hope if we assist with the basic education, health care and empowerment.
